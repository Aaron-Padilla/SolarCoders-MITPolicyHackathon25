# SolarCoders - MIT Policy Hackathon 2025 ☀️🧑‍💻

**Team:** SolarCoders  
**Event:** MIT Policy Hackathon 2025  
**Focus:** Fair Energy Pricing for Residential DERs

## 📖 Project Overview
This repository contains the data analysis and policy recommendations developed by the **SolarCoders** team. 

Our project addresses the "Rider E" charge in **Bowling Green, Ohio**—a monthly fee that penalizes residential solar adopters and stifles the economic feasibility of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs). We propose a **Fair Energy Pricing Framework** that balances utility cost recovery with fair compensation for the grid services (stability, peak shaving) provided by solar-plus-battery systems.

## 🏛️ Policy Proposal
> **Summary:** We recommend replacing the punitive "Rider E" charge with a time-varying export rate that incentivizes battery discharge during summer peak demand, creating a "win-win" for grid reliability and homeowner ROI.

**Key Recommendations**
1.  **Eliminate Rider E:** Remove the \$4/kW monthly fee for residents who install battery storage, cutting the ROI payback period from 48 years to ~26 years.
2.  **Time-Varying Export Rates:** Implement a "Peak" export rate ($0.15/kWh) during the top 5% of system demand hours (summer evenings) and a standard off-peak rate ($0.075/kWh).
3.  **Targeted Subsidies:** Leverage state funding and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) to provide 30% base subsidies, with an additional 10% for projects in low-income communities identified via the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI).

## 📊 Data & Methodology
We utilized the following datasets to model our financial and grid impact scenarios:
* **Bowling Green Municipal Utility Data:** Historical load profiles and "Rider E" fee structures.
* **Harper and Jansto Family Trust Case Study:** Real-world installation costs ($37k) and generation data (13.95 kW system) to model financial impacts.
* **FEMA & NOAA Data:** Flood risk maps and billion-dollar disaster event trends in Ohio.
* **CDC Social Vulnerability Index (SVI):** To identify equitable pricing needs for medium-high vulnerability areas.

**Methodology:**
* **Financial Modeling:** Projected 50-year cash flows comparing Status Quo (Rider E) vs. Proposed Framework.
* **Load Analysis:** Analyzed 2024-2025 load data to identify summer peak windows (June-Aug) where battery export is most valuable.
* **Peak Window Calculation:** Defined peak events as the top 5% of demand hours, estimating ~29 kWh export capacity per household event.
